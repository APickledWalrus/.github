# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome any form of contribution across all of our repositories.
We highly recommend that new contributors review this document.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For any contribution, please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

If you believe you have encountered an issue with one of our projects,
 please report it through the project repository's `Issues` tab using the `Bug Report` form.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security issues should not be reported through this form.
> Instead, please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

Before making a report, make sure the issue can be replicated without any optional third party dependencies or addons.
Additionally, ensure your issue has not already been reported by another user.
Following these steps increases the likelihood that we will be able to assist you.

## Suggestions

While we cannot implement every suggestion, we still love to hear your ideas.
Typically, suggestions may be posted in a project repository's `Issues` tab, using the `Suggestion` form.

## Pull Requests

We greatly appreciate code contributions to our projects, but there are guidelines on how they should be.

If you are a new contributor wondering where you can start, simply look for issues labeled "Good First Issue".
It is okay if you do not get everything right, as long as you make an effort to follow these guidelines.
We are happy to help you get your contribution ready!

For contributions not based on an existing issue, it would be wise to open an issue (depending on what you are contributing)
so that you can ensure your change is wanted. We do not want anyone to waste their time!

When submitting a pull request, the following guidelines are applicable to all of our projects:
* Avoid contributions that make a lot of changes.
  * Focus on fixing one bug or completing one feature per pull request.
  * You should avoid refactoring code that is unrelated to your changes.
  * The bigger the pull request, the longer the review phase will last.
* When applicable, you should include tests for your changes.
  * Of course, you should ensure that existing tests continue to pass.
* For bigger changes to core systems, it is better to coordinate with the maintainers.
* A contribution should target the repository's default branch, typically `main`.
  * This may differ for some repositories. Be sure to review the project's `README` file.

### Code Style

When making changes to a file, be sure to follow the code style that has already been established.
Using a different style will result in a prolonged review process for your contribution.
While code style will differ between projects, the following guidelines are applicable to all of our projects:
* Clear code should be prioritized over clever code.
  * Code should be written clearly and concisely.
  * For a reasonably skilled developer, the purpose and logic should be clear.
  * This does not mean you cannot have more complicated code.
    * In these cases, just be sure to have comments that step through the logic.
* Avoid lines that are too long (typically >120 characters).
* Comment liberally when it improves the readability of the code.
  * They should be properly formatted and easy to understand.
  * Use properly constructed sentences and punctuation.

### Code Review

Once your pull request is submitted, it will enter a review phase.
Pull requests marked as drafts may only receive general review comments.

**Authors**: When your contributions are questioned or critiqued, it is important to remember that these are not criticisms of you.
Reviewers are only trying to work with you to improve, and learning from your mistakes is valuable. \
**Reviewers**: When submitting a review, comments should not insult the author.
They should contain feedback and reasoning that the author can use to effectively make changes.

As one last note, discussion is healthy. It is okay to go back and forth on a proposal as long as that discussion remains peaceful.
When submitting comments, keep our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/APickledWalrus/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in mind.

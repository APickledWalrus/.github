# Security Policy

This document outlines our recommendation for handling security issues. \
If you discover a security issue, please do not hesitate to bring it to our attention.

## Reporting a Security Issue
> [!CAUTION]
> These issues should **NOT** be reported through a public GitHub issue, as that may lead to their further exposure.

Security issues may be reported through a project repository's `Security` tab.
If that is not possible, please get in touch with a project maintainer.

We are committed to addressing any security concerns that arise.

## Supported Versions

Typically, only the latest version of a project is supported.
However, some projects may have different policies.
Please review the project repository for specific details on supported versions.

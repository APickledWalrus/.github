# Help and Support

Need help with one of our projects?

We have compiled the resources below because we believe they provide valuable support for (or related to) our projects.

## General Support

For any of our project repositories, the `Discussions` tab may be used to post questions and receive answers. \
Every project has a `Wiki` tab that can be reviewed (before posting) for resolving common issues. \
Furthermore, our project repositories each have `README` files that typically contain project-specific resources.

If you believe you have found an issue with a project, you should use the project's `Issues` tab to report it.

### Recommendations For Posting Questions

When posting a question, please try to provide **as much detail as possible**. \
For example, it would be for beneficial for everyone to include project version information, attempted troubleshooting, and the code you are using (if applicable, but **do not** attach entire projects). \
The more detail you include, the likelier it is that you will get a reply.
